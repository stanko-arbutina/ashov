# Ashov
![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stanko-arbutina/ashov/master/ashov.jpeg)

__This is node module envisioned like a generic toolshed; it is a place for:__

- utilities I tend to reuse, but didn't find (or bother to find) a library which implements them
- utilities which are too small to warrant extraction to a full-fledged module
- sketching new ideas

Any dependants should depend only on exact versions.

## Overview

Each of the sub-utilities is in separate folder in project root; these contain tests for that utility and a small README.   

## LICENSE
